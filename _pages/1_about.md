### Personal
My girlfriend describes me as someone with black-cat energy with occasional golden retriever sprinkles xD.
I believe all individuals have an interesting life story, and as a result I love to listen people talk.

I find it impossible to balance, especially in pursuits, so I'm either utterly obsessed or utterly disinterested. I love travelling to random towns, obscure places, and asking people there what they think of something. I HATE museums. 

[Man is condemned to be free](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/148810-man-is-condemned-to-be-free-condemned-because-he-did#:~:text=man%20is%20condemned%20to%20be%20free), but he's truly liberated on a motorcycle. Sorry, Sartre, you just never rode a bike. I devour
riding motorcyles, for weeks, for thousands of kilometers, across hundreds of places.

I enjoy reading (absolutely anything, even political pamphlets), cooking, navy cross-fit, kickboxing, surfing, running, dog-walks,
air-rifle shooting, playing devil's advocate, seeing tree leaves flutter in the wind, working out, listening to music, memorising national anthems of different countries, and enjoy tons of other things I don't remember.

#### My Story

**1998, I was born in [Akola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akola), Maharashtra, India.** It's a small off-the-radar town known for BLISTERING summers, [Varhadi](https://hogr.app/blog/regional-cuisines-of-maharashtra/) and [Saoji](https://hogr.app/blog/regional-cuisines-of-maharashtra/) cuisine.

**Growing up in Akola** I grew up with lots of love, and fat, reading a lot, abhorring school, solving math problems for fun.

**2014-16, [JEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination_%E2%80%93_Advanced) years in Akola** Thought it's the most -only- important thing in the world; I was very wrong. But as Roger Federer [says](https://home.dartmouth.edu/news/2024/06/2024-commencement-address-roger-federer#:~:text=When%20you%E2%80%99re%20playing,clarity%20and%20focus.), "Once you score a point, it's great, but it's behind you. Move forward"

**2016-2020** Spent four wonderful years at IIT-Bombay. Travelled countries, was surrounded by some of the most amazing, talented, and smartest people. Felt inspired and depressed and motivated and humbled and intellectually stimulated. I could've used my years much better.

**2020 COVID** Opted out of college placements, wanted to join a Chinese AI start-up in Shenzhen, ended up joining [Wadhwani-AI](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/). During the first COVID wave'20 I was sanitizing mangoes, eggs, among others.

**2020-2022** My time at Wadhwani-AI taught me that XGBoost is the GOAT; shiny new models(techniques) will get you a paper but, *often*, no real value; free investor money is poison; in ML, theory gives you deeper understanding but quality data gives you real performance. Understood [Yogi-Berra.](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/yogi_berra_141506) Procrastinated and eventually dropped on a Start-up idea.

**Also 2020-2022**  Went to Everest and Annapurna Basecamp, backpacked across SE Asia. [Angkor-Wat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat) deserves to be among 7 wonders, not Taj Mahal. Rode motorcyle across villages in Indian states, saw the raw and rural India, had conversations with real people; felt priviledged, and obligated towards them.

**2023-2024** Had fermented rice beer in a jungle with [Naga-people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_people), met my girlfriend; traveled with her; she introduced me to surfing, made a 3500KM long motorcycle trip to eat a Horlicks Ice-Cream in [Udupi](https://youtu.be/PIsPdbLTHUA?si=u7T4FgKZw_gPJGjD) in pouring monsoon rain, got into ELLIS PhD program and started my PhD.

**2024-Now**~~I was forced to~~ Took some ~~lot of~~ courses because I had no masters, best things I learned: Quantum-Information-Processing/ML; Formal Verification; Quantum Computing is a field with ~~no~~ solution (yet) ~~desperately~~ looking for a problem, passed my Qualification Exam, was in Saarbrucken, Germany, searched for reasons to like it-- it's [kinder pingui](https://www.kinder.com/de/de/kinder-pingui)!! Currently in Cambridge, UK.
