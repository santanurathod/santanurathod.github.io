### <a name="research"></a> Research Interests
~~I'm interested in designing neural network architectures for newer tasks and unseen datasets, exploiting various symmetries and invariances that exist in them. I am currently working on trying to model dynamic-FBA using neural ODE family of models.~~ Life's too short to not *try* and learn everything you possibly can. These days, however, I'm motivated by building novel (ML) algorithms and methodologies around HUGE data being generated in the multi-omics (genomics; transcriptomics; proteomics; metabolomics) to build biological deep-learning (world) models which will enable personalized treatments, and better understanding of life in general.

More specifically I'm interested in ~~everything ML~~:

* All things Dynamical/Generative AI (NeuralODEs/SDEs; Optimal-Transport; Flow/Diffusion Models)
* Geometric-DL
* Precision Medicine (in the context of drug target identification)
* Reasoning Models
* And more things

I am co-advised by [Xiao Zhang](https://xiao-zhang.net/) and [Pietro Lio](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/).
