<h2>Varanasi, India, a place like no other</h2>
<div class="photo-gallery">
  <img src="/assets/img/3_varanasi/photo_1.jpg" alt="Photo 1" data-caption="Varanasi is an overload, simply, in every sense of the word. Religious, historical, cultural, gastric, colorful, populous, visual, perceptual —OVERLOAD. Since it's one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, it's impossible to comment on any few aspects of it, do justice and not be shallow; instead, I'll just say that I think it's a live case study of what time eventually does to a civilisation, if it survives long enough. Having seen everything from famines, bountiful harvests, glory days, depression, regime changes, having absorbed everything from paper to gunpowder to radios to smartphones, it seems to have a very distilled outlook on life- calm, composed, and an acceptance of life's transience; future will happen, past has already happened, but you exist here and now so why worry being on time anywhere :p, as long as the present is worth the wait. P.S. That's a Naga Sadhu in pic 1, his axiom is that a. Humans should strive to be at peace, b. Desire is what's at odds with attaining that peace. He thus has no desires, or so he says, and owns nothing and is concerned with nothing. All he likes is aalo-matar and smoking his chillam. Although I disagree with a lot that he said, any debate with him was futile because we have very different axioms to begin with. There's only acknowledgment of alternate views (mostly from my end, he's too detached to give a fsck xD)">

<h2>Konkan Coast during monsoon, and its many Temples, India</h2>
<div class="photo-gallery">
  <img src="/assets/img/4_west_india_temples/photo_1.jpg" alt="Photo 1" data-caption="Although I’m not religious, I think it’s important to understand religion to understand a nation because EVERY nation is built in the image of its dominant religion (e.g. American capitalism and the influence of Protestant work ethic). Observing temples is just a humble first step in the case of India. Now, it’s fascinating how the density and architecture of the temples changes within a span of 200KMs when you enter Southern India, from the West Coast, you see a clear demarcation in terms of how the temples are built, how people organise around the temples, and the order in which the elements (bells, baths, lamps, etc.) are placed. Do cultural fault lines precede linguistic ones or is it the other way around? I think it’s the other way around when the religion is homogenous but not otherwise, else Middle-East would’ve been peaceful because Arabic is fairly common. What’s also interesting is the sheer number of temples you’ll find in the West Coast, especially in rural Karnataka where every village seems to have its own major temple, with several small ones scattered across. And it’s amazing that unlike Northern India, common temples here are fairly old, with stone carvings, stone pavements, etc. I think it’s because this region wasn’t invaded and raided enough. There’s Nilgiri and Sahyadari to the East, Arabian Sea to the West, Indian Ocean to the South, & only a slight opening in the North, before the Deccan plateau begins. So you’d rather pillage areas around Gujarat, e.g. Somnath, than traverse along a narrow coast for seafood and gold. So this region also provides us a glimpse of what rest of the nation probably would’ve looked like had it been not raided constantly. So essentially, Southern India got to keep its heritage, intact, owing to invasion brunt faced by Northern India and so maybe should pay homage in some way(transferring all the tax money northwards is not the right way xD) And intact not just in terms of the architecture or culture but also in term of mannerisms, because people here are too sweet and cordial compared to the rough mannerisms found up North, which again, I think, is an adaption mechanism from the all the raids from NW.">
